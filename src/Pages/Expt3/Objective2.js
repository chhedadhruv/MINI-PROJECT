          Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion is an approach which derives the
          method of finding the number of elements in the union of two finite
          sets. This is used for solving combinations and probability problems
          when it is necessary to find a counting method, which makes sure that
          an object is not counted twice.

          Consider two finite sets A and B. We can denote the Principle of
          Inclusion and Exclusion formula as follows:-
        </p>
        <p>n(A⋃B) = n(A) + n(B) – n(A⋂B)</p>

        <p>
          If we have 3 sets A, B, and C, then according to the Principle of
          Inclusion and Exclusion,
        </p>
        <p>
          n(A⋃B⋃C) = n(A) + n(B) + n(C) – n(A⋂B) – n(A⋂C) – n(B⋂C) + n(A⋂B⋂C)
        </p>
        <img src={Image13} height="250" alt=""></img>
      </div>
