        <h3>Graph Theory:</h3>
        <p>
          The procedure to draw a graph for any given function or to calculate
          any function is the algorithm of the graph. Basically, there are
          predefined steps or sets of instructions that have to be followed to
          solve a problem using graphical methods. There are different types of
          algorithms which the graph theory follows, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Bellman-Ford algorithm</li>
          <li>Borůvka’s algorithm</li>
          <li>Ford–Fulkerson algorithm</li>
          <li>Edmonds–Karp algorithm and many more.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </>
