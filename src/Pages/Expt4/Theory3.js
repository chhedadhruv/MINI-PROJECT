        <h4>Graph Theory:</h4>
        <p>
          Graph theory can be described as a study of the graph. A graph is a
          type of mathematical structure which is used to show a particular
          function with the help of connecting a set of points. We can use
          graphs to create a pairwise relationship between objects. The graph is
          created with the help of vertices and edges. The vertices are also
          known as the nodes, and edges are also known as the lines. In any
          graph, the edges are used to connect the vertices.
        </p>
        <p>
          A graph can be used to show any data in an organized manner with the
          help of pictorial representation. We can show the relationship between
          the variable quantities with the help of a graph. In graph theory, we
          usually use the graph to show a set of objects, and these objects are
          connected with each other in some sense. The objects can be described
          as mathematical concepts, which can be expressed with the help of
          nodes or vertices, and the relation between pairs of nodes can be
          expressed with the help of edges.
