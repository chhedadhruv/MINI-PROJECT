          The aim of the experiment on recurrence relations in discrete
          structures and graph theory is to provide students with a practical
          understanding of the concept of recurrence relations and their
          applications in solving problems related to discrete structures and
          graph theory. The experiment aims to help students develop a deeper
          understanding of recurrence relations by providing them with hands-on
          experience in solving problems that require the use of recurrence
          relations.
