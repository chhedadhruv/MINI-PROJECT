        <h4>Warshall Algorithm:</h4>
        <p>
          Warshall's algorithm is used to determine the transitive closure of a
          directed graph or all paths in a directed graph by using the adjacency
          matrix. For this, it generates a sequence of n matrices. Where, n is
          used to describe the number of vertices. R(0), ..., R(k-1), R(k), ...
          , R(n) A sequence of vertices is used to define a path in a simple
          graph. In the kth matrix (R(k)), (rij(k)), the element's definition at
          the ith row and jth column will be one if it contains a path from vi
          to vj. For all intermediate vertices, wq is among the first k vertices
          that mean 1 ≤ q ≤ k.
